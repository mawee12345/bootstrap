<p><p>My name is Maureen Paula G. Repollo.I was born on September  7,2000, in Urdaneta City a small city in Pangasinan. 
Iâ€™m the Second  child and the Oldest girl sibling in a family of six. My
father, Mr. Juanito Repollo is a General laborer while my mother,Mrs. Normita Repollo is Vendor in our town.</p> </p>

    <div class="row-sms-4">
    <p><p> I attended Public Schools in our Barangay San Juan from 
      kindergarten until sixth grade. While there I participated in choir, Girl Scouts,board games, 
      volleyball, and badminton. I was on honor roll and received an academic
      achievement award. Attending a Public school helped me to grow academically because there is always a competetion, 
      grown as a better  person , and gaves me high moral standards. In seventh to tenth grade I attended Mataas na Paaralang Juan C. Laya
      . I was involved in volleyball,and  badminton. I was on honor
    student every grading , and received awards.</p></p>
    </div>

    <div class="row-sm-4">
        
      <p><p>I  am very motivated to create the best possible future for myself, and have worked
very hard to set that up. I have been on the honor roll every marking period thus far in my high
school career. I received my academic  letters,  and an academic achievement award. Some of my strengths include being a
hard worker, dedicated, self-motivated, and organized. My weaknesses are that sometimes I am
overly ambitious and take on too much at once, and that I tend to expect too much of others.</p></p>

    <div class="row-sms-4">
      <p> <p>I currently attend College in pangasinan State University(Urdaneta campus). I am a taking Bachelor of science in Information technology.
        Even when i am a honor student on my high school days i still got low grades in college. I Thought college will be not so hard but i end up
       fail in some subjects but recently i am doing my  best to be a regular student again. Pursue my dreams and work hard for my family.
